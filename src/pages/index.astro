         <h2>Welcome to the Hunter's Beach Cottage Association</h2>
         <p>Nestled along the scenic shores of our beloved waterfront, the Hunter’s Beach Cottage Association (HBCA) represents a community of cottagers who are passionate about preserving the natural beauty, safety, and shared spirit of Hunter’s Beach.</p>
         <p>Formed to bring together property owners in the area, HBCA serves as a collective voice and support system for those who call Hunter’s Beach their home away from home. Whether you're here for summer weekends, peaceful fall getaways, or year-round tranquility, we believe in responsible stewardship, mutual respect, and having each other's backs—whether it’s a storm cleanup, a road issue, or a good old-fashioned potluck.</p>
         <h2>What We Do</h2>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Road Maintenance & Infrastructure:</strong> We coordinate maintenance and improvements for our shared roads, ensuring safe and sustainable access.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> From shoreline preservation to waste management, we work to protect the natural ecosystems that make Hunter’s Beach special.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> We host an Annual General Meeting and provide updates on key issues, decisions, and upcoming projects affecting the area.</li>
            <li><strong>Representation:</strong> HBCA advocates on behalf of members with local government, utility companies, and other stakeholders as needed.</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
         <p>HBCA wasn’t created just to manage the basics—it was built to foster a sense of community. When we pool our resources and look out for each other, we create more than just a neighbourhood—we build a legacy.</p>
