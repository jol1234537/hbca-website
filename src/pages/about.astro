    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
      The Hunter’s Beach Cottage Association (HBCA) is a not-for-profit corporation dedicated to representing the collective interests of cottagers and property owners along the shoreline and backlot areas of Hunter’s Beach. Incorporated on <strong>November 28, 1994</strong>, under the <strong>jurisdiction of Ontario, Canada</strong>, the association was created to ensure the long-term stewardship, accessibility, and sustainability of this unique waterfront community. We are proud to remain <strong>actively incorporated</strong> and committed to the values of transparency, inclusion, and shared responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is to preserve the natural beauty of Hunter’s Beach while fostering a sense of community and cooperation among our members. We oversee essential shared services such as private road maintenance, environmental protection efforts, seasonal trail upkeep, and community safety initiatives. In doing so, HBCA serves as both an operational body and a platform for collaboration, where members can voice concerns, propose ideas, and shape the direction of our cottage community together.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a not-for-profit, every dollar collected through membership dues is reinvested directly back into the community—whether through gravel for roads, signage for safety, legal consultation, or organizing our Annual General Meeting. We do not operate for commercial gain; instead, we operate for the good of all members, guided by our bylaws and decisions made collectively at member meetings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond maintenance and administration, HBCA is about building a strong and respectful community. Our members support one another through everything from storm cleanups to informal gatherings. We strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone—from long-time landholders to new cottage owners—feels welcomed and heard. The association also works closely with local authorities and regulatory bodies when necessary, ensuring our voices are unified and respected.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the decades, HBCA has grown from a small working group into a structured and stable organization. As stewards of the land and neighbours by the lake, we look forward to many more seasons of shared success, meaningful conversations, and quiet sunsets on the shore. We welcome all property owners to become active participants in the association and help shape the future of Hunter’s Beach.
